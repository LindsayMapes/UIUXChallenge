    <p>Michelle uses wallpops website to conceptualize her DIY tiling home remodel projects.
        Michelle coordinates her household that includes 2 children in elementary school, her full-time working husband,
        one dog and a rabbit. The family has recently upgraded to a larger home and she spends lots of free time trying to
        make it "home" with stylish yet affordable DIY home improvement projects. Websites like Wallpops not only provide
        supplies for sprucing up a room with a fresh, new look, but more importantly, this website has a tool that allows
        Michelle to see in real time how her floor tile and wall tile selections will look so Michelle doesn't choose a
        look that she will regret later. She doesn't have the time or funds to re-do her interior design endeavors.</p>
